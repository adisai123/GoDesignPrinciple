## Single-responsibility principle:

A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.

## Openâ€“closed principle

"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

## Liskov substitution principle

"Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." 

## Interface segregation principle

"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

## Dependency inversion principle

One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
